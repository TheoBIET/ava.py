# 🤖 Ava.py&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Ava.py is a set of artificial intelligence algorithms combined in a single application. Ava is a virtual assistant that can help you with any task. Just ask her a question and she'll answer. 

This is a study project which will probably be improved regularly. Its future aim is to move away from OpenAI APIs as far as possible, using only local, open-source models.

- This project is currently **under development.** 🏗️
